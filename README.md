#   Title of Project: Autometed Complaint Management System
# Introduction
This project aims to address citizens' challenges more efficiently by ensuring that reported issues reach the responsible authorities promptly. It is designed to facilitate quick resolution of problems affecting the community. Additionally, the system provides timely feedback to the individual who submitted the issue via SMS, using the phone number they registered with.
# System Users and the roles
This system comprises four types of users, each with distinct roles and responsibilities. These users include the Regional Commissioner Officer (RCO), the Regional Secretary (RS), the Complaint Officer (CO), and the citizen.

The citizen is responsible for self-registration within the system. After registering, they can submit complaints related to issues affecting their community. Additionally, citizens have the ability to edit or delete their submitted complaints in case of errors or changes.

The Regional Commissioner Officer (RCO) holds a supervisory role. Their responsibilities include registering both the Regional Secretary (RS) and the Complaint Officer (CO). Furthermore, the RCO receives complaints submitted by citizens and has the authority to forward these complaints to the appropriate RS or CO for resolution, particularly when the RCO is unable to resolve the issue personally.

Once feedback is provided by the RCO, RS, or CO regarding a particular complaint, the system automatically sends that feedback to the respective citizen via SMS, using the phone number provided during registration.
